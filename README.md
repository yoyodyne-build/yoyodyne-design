The Nx monorepo infrastructure to manage my demo **Lectroids** design system.

## TODO:

- [ ] Get common button-styles typing correct for use with Angular
- [ ] Figure out how to write a proper Angular story for Storybook
- [ ] Test publish to local verdaccio repository
- [ ] Document process for testing an npm package with the local-repository
- [ ] Some form of tests - e2e or unit - but something for an impartial sanity check
- [ ] Deploy `0.0.1` to actual npm repository
- [ ] Verify packages work in both Angular and React dummy applications.
- [ ] Work out the minimum amount of controls needed for a page layout
- [ ] Look into creating a shared, hostable Storybook site for entire project
- [ ] Actually bring some "design" to the design system
